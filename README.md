# Aroon and Ulcer Index Technical Analysis Indicators
My implementation of Aroon, Aroon Oscillator and Ulcer Index technical analysis indicators in Python. The script also provides some examples of applying these indicators to TSLA, APPL, GOOGL, ES stock data (taken from TradeStation trading platform) and visualizing with simple graphs using python's matplotlib.

This was part of the assignment for my "Financial Intelligence" university course.
